# Exercise Detector React Component

**Notes:** 
1. This code is based on [tfjs-posenet](https://github.com/jscriptcoder/tfjs-posenet). I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the original coder for their valuable contribution.
2. The original code utilizes the PoseNet model, but I have made modifications to use Blazepose for the specific purpose of detecting exercise positions in a laying down posture.
3. The component is currently designed to detect three exercise errors (bicep curl, squat, push-up) using rule-based techniques.
